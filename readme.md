# Start Lab

## Pre-Requisites
- You are expected to review the `Entities of Java` written lecture prior to working on this lab. If you are not familiar with the concepts being explored in the lab, please make sure to review the study material first.

## Description
Welcome to your first lab! This first exercise is designed to teach you the basic workflow of completing coding assignments.

## Completing the Lab
You will be editing the file `Questions.java`. You will also need to review, but not edit, the `Vehicle.java` file. Both files can be found under the `src/main/java` package. Review the file's code and code comments for further instructions.

Tasks to complete within the `Questions.java` file:
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `question1`
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `question2`
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `question3`

## Running Tests
If you look within the `src/test/java` folder, you will find the Java class `QuestionsTest.java`. The `src/test/java` folder will contain your test files.  Test cases will be instrumental in completing labs. The methods in this class function as a way to check the expected output of code to what is actually output from the current structure of the code. 
- You cannot edit these files, but they are there for you to optionally review.

To run the tests, click on the Testing tab (test beaker icon on the left-hand side) and run the test cases by using the "Run Test" button (play icon). Please ensure that you do not already have the program running.

You can optionally run the program for manual testing by switching to the file named `Main.java` under the `src/main/java` package and clicking the "Run Java" button (play icon) on the top-right of VSCode:
